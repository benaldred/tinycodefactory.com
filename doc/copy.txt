what we do
We build quality web applications using Ruby on Rails. We have a specific coding standard to ensure our apps meet a certain level of quality. We can also bring your existing app up to our standards.


We also have experience creating prototype apps and helping companies innovate, working with technology startups to turn ideas into a business and creating minimum viable products.


We are passionate about the web and constantly keep up with technology making sure we know what's what. This means we know and can use the right tool for the right job and we are not afraid to try something completely new.

We have a more detailed list of the services we provide.


how we work
We use short development cycles and close collaboration to build the app/product that you need. Short iterations let you see progress, give feedback and allow you to change your requirements and fix problems quickly.

Simply put, we treat our clients how we would like to be treated. We believe that clear and honest and communication builds trust and a lasting relationship. We rely on word of mouth to grow the business, so happy clients and customers are key.

Sometimes it can seem like buzz word bingo but we really do practice agile development and lean product development, we are software craftsmen, we don't work we rework

If you would like you can read more about our the set of principles we have built the company culture around.

who we are
We work with big clients (a small start-ups too) but we stay tiny for a reason. Staying small and lean allows us to react quickly in an ever changing environment. 
We are based in Manchester and have lots of experience working remotely, so location is not a problem. We can also work on-site, depending on your need.


The team

Ben is a jack of all trades, having worked at the BBC for years and at a small start up has experience at every level. A multi disciplined miestro working on the front-end, back-end, product development and design. 

Gill handles administrative tasks for Tiny Code Factory and is also Ben's wife. She is a great proof reader and not really a sock monkey (she is very camera shy).

We have a team of friends that we trust to call on at any time.
